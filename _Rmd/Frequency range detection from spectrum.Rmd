We are often interested in getting the frequency range of acoustic signals, either because we have specific predictions about its variation or simply because we want to measure other stuff within that range. Measuring frequency range is typically done by drawing boxes in *Raven/Avisoft/Syrinx*. An alternative way, and potentially less subjective, is to infer the range from the energy distribution in the frequency domain applying amplitude thresholds on spectrums. I have added two new functions to [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) that do exactly that:

* `freq_range_detec`: detects the frequency range of signals in wave objects (like a [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave) function). Can produce images n the graphic device if `plot = TRUE`.

* `freq_range`: applies `freq_range_detec` iteratively on signals listed in a selection table (like most [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) functions). If `img = TRUE` image files including a spectrogram and a frequency spectrum are produced for each selection. 

This post shows how these functions work.

 Let's first Load/install [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR):
 
```{r frange_1 load libraries and functions, eval = F}

if(!require(githubinstall)) install.packages("githubinstall")

githubinstall("warbleR", ask = FALSE)

library("warbleR")

```

```{r frange_2 read data, eval= T, echo=F}

# setwd(tempdir())

library(warbleR)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)


Phae.stri <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/Websites/Blog/Phae.stri.RDS")

writeWave(Phae.stri[[1]], "Phaethornis-striigularis-154074.wav")

snr <- Phae.stri[[2]]

ad <- snr[rank(-snr$SNR) < 60, ]

```

We will run the functions on signals detected on a recording from a male [Striped-throated Hermit (*Phaethornis striigularis*)](https://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/Species-Account/nb/species/stther2/overview) from [Xeno-Canto](http://xeno-canto.org). We can download the sound file and convert it into wave format as follows:

```{r frange_3, eval = F}

# set temporary working directory
 setwd(tempdir())

# Query and download  Xeno-Canto for metadata using genus and species as keywords
Phae.stri <- quer_xc(qword = "nr:154074", download = TRUE, pb = FALSE)

# Convert mp3 to wav format
# Simultaneously lower sampling rate to speed up down stream analyses
mp32wav(samp.rate = 22.05, pb = FALSE)

```

Now, we need to detect the time "coordinates" of the signals in the sound file using `auto_detec`:

```{r frange_4 set aesthetics for plotting, eval = F}

ad <- auto_detec(wl = 200, threshold = 3.5, ssmooth = 1200, bp = c(4, 9.6), 
                 pb = FALSE,  mindur = 0.1, maxdur = 0.25, img = FALSE)

```

And selec the highest signal-to-noise ratio signals (just for the sake of the example):

```{r frange_5, eval = FALSE}

snr <- sig2noise(ad, pb = FALSE, mar = 0.05)

ad <- snr[rank(-snr$SNR) < 60, ]

```

Let's take a look at the subset of signals that we will analyze (the output of `catalog` will be found in your working directory):

```{r frange_6, eval = F}

catalog(ad, nrow = 5, ncol = 4, mar = 0.01, flim = c(3.5, 10.5), 
        labels = "selec", pal = reverse.heat.colors, pb = FALSE)

open_wd()

```

```{r frange_7, eval = F, echo = F}

Phae.stri <- list(readWave("Phaethornis-striigularis-154074.wav"), snr)

saveRDS(Phae.stri, "~/Dropbox/Websites/Blog/Phae.stri.RDS")

```

### freq_range_detec

Now we are ready to run the new functions. `freq_range_detec` works on wave objects. In this example we use it to detect the frequency range of the first selection in "ad". But first the selection has to be read as a wave object into *R*: 

```{r frange_8, eval = FALSE}

w2 <- readWave(as.character(ad$sound.files[2]), from = ad$start[2], 
               to = ad$end[2], units = "seconds")

freq_range_detec(w2, bp = c(2, 9.6), fsmooth = 1, ovlp = 95, 
                 wl = 200, threshold = 8)

```

![frange2](/img/frange_freq_range_detec.png)

We can look at the detection for each selection in the 'ad' data frame using a loop as follows:

```{r frange_9, eval = F, echo = T}

for(i in 1:nrow(ad))
{
  wv <- readWave(as.character(ad$sound.files[i]), from = ad$start[i], 
                 to = ad$end[i], units = "seconds")

freq_range_detec(wv, bp = c(2, 12), fsmooth = 1, ovlp = 95, wl = 200, 
                 threshold = 8, flim = c(0, 13), 
                 main = paste("selection", i))

Sys.sleep(0.8)
}
```


```{r  frange_10 create gif, eval = F, echo = F}

setwd(tempdir())

#start graphic device to create image files
tiff("fee%04d.tiff",res = 120, width = 700, height = 480)

#loop to create image files 
for(i in 1:nrow(ad))
{
  wv <- readWave(as.character(ad$sound.files[i]), from = ad$start[i], to = ad$end[i], units = "seconds")

freq_range_detec(wv, bp = c(2, 12), fsmooth = 1, ovlp = 95, wl = 200, threshold = 8, flim = c(0, 13), main = paste("selection", i))
}

dev.off()

if (!file.exists("y.mp4"))
system("ffmpeg -framerate 0.7 -i fee%04d.tiff -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 2 -pix_fmt yuv420p y.mp4")

if (!file.exists("y.gif"))
system("ffmpeg  -t 20 -ss 00:00:00 -i y.mp4 y.gif")

# unlink(list.files(pattern = "\\.tiff$"))

```

In most cases the detection is good. However, there are some issues with highly amplitude-modulated signals (e.g. high variation in amplitude across the signal). Some parameter tweeking will be required to improve those detections. 


### freq_range

As mentioned above, the frequency range can be calculated for all selection in a selection table using `freq_range`:

```{r frange_11, eval = F}

fr_ad <- freq_range(X = ad, bp = c(2, 12), fsmooth = 0.001, ovlp = 95, 
                          wl = 200, threshold = 10, img = FALSE)

View(fr_ad)

```

```{r frange_12, echo= FALSE}
# setwd(tempdir())

fr_ad <- freq_range(X = ad, bp = c(2, 12), fsmooth = 0.001, ovlp = 95, 
                    wl = 200, threshold = 10, img = FALSE)

kbl <- kable(fr_ad, align = "c", row.names = F,  format = "html")

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, width = "740px",  height= "600px",
box_css = "border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 1px; ", extra_css = NULL)

kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 13)
```

The range can then be used as a band pass filter in other [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) functions like `trackfreqs`, `dfts` or `specan`:

```{r frange_13, eval = F}

sp <- specan(X = fr_ad, wl = 200, bp = "frange", ovlp = 90, pb = FALSE, 
             threshold = 15)

View(sp)

```


```{r frange_14, echo= FALSE}
# setwd(tempdir())

sp <- specan(X = fr_ad, wl = 200, bp = "frange", ovlp = 90, 
             pb = FALSE, threshold = 15)

kbl <- kable(sp, align = "c", row.names = F,  format = "html")

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, width = "740px", height= "600px",
box_css = "border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 1px; ", extra_css = NULL) 

kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 13)
```

That's it!
