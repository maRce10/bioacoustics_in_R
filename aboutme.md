I am broadly interested in the evolution of behavior from a evolutionary and cultural perspective, as well as the interplay between these two. I worked on hummingbird behavior during my PhD, and also explored the evolution of learned vocal signals in other groups using comparative analyses during my time at the Lab of O. I am currently working on social communication in communal roosting bats as postdoc at Universidad de Costa Rica.

I also made computational tools for the analysis of animal vocalizations on R. [Grace Smith-Vidaurre](http://gsmithvi.github.io/) and I created the R package  [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR), which provides tools to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds. I also mantain the R package [Rraven](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rraven), [baRulho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baRulho), [NatureSounds](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NatureSounds) and [dynaSpec](https://marce10.github.io/dynaSpec/).
