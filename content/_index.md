The advantage of R over most common sound analysis software (e.g. Raven, SAP, Avisoft) is its higher flexibility, which allows the implementation of custom made analyses that better fit the research questions and the characteristics of the vocalizations. However, this requires some proficiency in R coding that may dissuade beginners. Hopefully the codes I make available here will encourage bioacousticians to take advantage of this powerful tool.

Most of the tools I have developed for acoustic analysis are now available in the packages [warbleR](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR), [Rraven](https://marce10.github.io/Rraven), [baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho), [PhenotypeSpace](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/) and [dynaSpec](https://marce10.github.io/dynaSpec/). I will also post R scripts to detail the usage of new additions to this package.

Sound analysis in R has been made possible owing to the awesome package [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave). I recommend taking a look at [Seewaveâ€™s website](http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave) to learn more about its different tools. I also include code containing functions from the packages [monitoR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=monitoR), [tuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tuneR), [bioacoustics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bioacoustics) and [soundgen](https://cran.r-project.org/package=soundgen).
