I am interested in understanding how behavior has evolved and which factors have influenced it, spanning both cultural and evolutionary timescales. I am also interested in the possible macro-evolutionary consequences of these processes. I tackle these questions by studying the communication systems of (mostly neotropical) taxa, making use of 'single species' behavioral studies, comparative phylogenetic methods and cutting-edge data analyses.

I also enjoy developing my own computational tools for customizing data analysis. 
I'm deeply involved in the development of computational tools for the analysis of behavioral data. I have created the R package [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) that provides functions to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds. I also made available two R packages, [Rraven](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rraven) and [NatureSounds](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NatureSounds), that aim to simplify the use of R for bioacoustic research. More recently I released the R packages [baRulho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baRulho), to quantify acoustic signal transmission and degradation, and [ohun](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ohun), to optimize automatic detection. New functions as well as other more elaborated analyses are detailed in my blog [Bioacoustics in R](https://marce10.github.io/bioacoustics_in_R/).
